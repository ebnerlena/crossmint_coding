# Crossmint Coding Challenge

**Author**: Lena Ebner

Welcome to our Crossmint coding challenge, in which you will help us mint a new megaverse into existence!

Megaverses are 2D spaces comprised of combinations of different astral objects: 🪐POLYanets with 🌙SOLoons around them and ☄comETHs floating around.

Your job as the master of the megaverse will be to create one with some given parameters and shapes. You will use a megaverse creator API to help you with such legendary quest.

The challenge is composed of 2 phases. In the first one you will learn how to interact with the API and create some 🪐POLYanets and validate them. In the second one you will create a bigger megaverse with some peculiar shape.

- [Phase 1 Solution](./01-phase/)
- [Phase 2 Solution](./02-phase/)
- [Docs](./docs/)

## Instructions

- Begin by going to https://challenge.crossmint.com, please read carefully the challenge background.
- Then go to challenge.crossmint.com/candidate and enter your CANDIDATE ID: <INSERT_HERE>
- Follow instructions on screen.

## Evaluation Criteria

- The code is clean and easy to understand
- You model the problem properly, including classes / interfaces, extension when applied, etc.
- You avoid duplication and encourage extension for similar use cases
- Your logic is properly abstracted in classes (or equivalent), functions, variables, etc.
- Your solution is automated (i.e. you don’t manually call the API to create the 100+ entities required for Phase 2)
- We expect the problem to be a little over-engineered, take a little time to show off what you know. But this should be done to a reasonable amount, don't go overboard.
