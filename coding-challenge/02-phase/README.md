# Phase 2: Crossmint logo. With 🌙SOLoons and ☄comETHs!

In this second phase, you will have to build another megaverse… including the shape of our logo!

This new map has some other entities as well: 🌙SOLoons and ☄comETHs.

🌙SOLoons can only be adjacent to a 🪐POLYanet, and they can have a variety of colors.
☄comETHs can go alone in the universe, but they have a direction they’re facing.
You can see their specifications and APIs on the same Docs.

IMPORTANT: Building the map manually is NOT a solution we are looking for here. There are multiple ways to solve this problem, but maybe the /api/map/[candidateId]/goal endpoint might help.

The final result will look like this:
